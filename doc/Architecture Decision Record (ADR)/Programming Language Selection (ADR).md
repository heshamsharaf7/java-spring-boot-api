# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)!

**Title:** Programming Language Selection

**Date:** 3/12/2024

**Author:** Architecture Team

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** In the process of selecting a programming language for our project, we have evaluated various options considering factors such as developer productivity, ecosystem maturity, community support, performance, and scalability. This decision is crucial as the selected programming language will influence the development approach, tooling, and overall architecture of the application.

**Constrains** : Need for a programming language that promotes rapid development and follows best practices.
Requirement for a mature and well-supported ecosystem with a rich set of libraries and frameworks.
Availability of extensive community support to address technical challenges and provide guidance.
Support for building scalable and maintainable applications capable of handling growing requirements.
Familiarity and proficiency of the development team with the selected programming language.

**Alternative Solutions**

 -  **java:**
	- Pros: Mature ecosystem, strong community support, performance, and scalability.
    - Cons: Boilerplate code, slower development compared to modern alternatives.

 - **Python:**
   - Pros: Concise syntax, extensive libraries, suitable for rapid prototyping.
   - Cons: Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) may hinder concurrency, not as performant as compiled languages.

- **Node.js:**
	- Pros: Event-driven architecture, non-blocking I/O, lightweight and scalable.
	- Cons: Callback hell, asynchronous programming can lead to complexity, less suitable for CPU-bound tasks.

**Decision:** We have chosen Spring Boot, a Java-based framework, as the programming language for our project.

**Rationale**

- **Mature Ecosystem**: Java boasts a mature ecosystem with a vast array of libraries, frameworks, and tools, including Spring Boot, which accelerates development and promotes best practices.

- **Community Support**: Java has a large and active community of developers, providing extensive support, documentation, and resources to address technical challenges and share knowledge.

- **Performance and Scalability**: Java applications, particularly when utilizing frameworks like Spring Boot, are known for their performance, scalability, and reliability, making them suitable for building enterprise-grade applications capable of handling high loads.

- **Familiarity and Proficiency**: The development team is proficient in Java and has extensive experience with Spring Boot, minimizing the learning curve and enabling rapid development from the outset.

**Consequences**
- **Developer Productivity**: Leveraging Spring Boot may enhance developer productivity due to its convention-over-configuration approach, dependency injection, and built-in features for rapid development.
- **Performance Optimization**: We will need to focus on performance optimization techniques, such as caching, database indexing, and efficient algorithm design, to ensure optimal application performance.
- **Integration Challenges**: Integrating with external systems or services may require additional effort to ensure compatibility and seamless communication.
- **Maintainability**: Java applications, including those built with Spring Boot, require careful design and architecture to maintain code cleanliness, modularity, and extensibility over time.
- **Revisit Date:** This decision should be revisited in 5 years
