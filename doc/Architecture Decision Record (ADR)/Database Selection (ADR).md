# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)!

**Title:** Database Selection

**Date:** 3/12/2024

**Author:** Architecture Team

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** In the process of selecting a suitable database system for our project, we have evaluated various options considering factors such as data structure, scalability, performance, and community support. This decision is crucial as the selected database will serve as the foundation for storing and managing essential data within our application.

**Constrains** : 
-	ACID compliance required for ensuring data integrity.
-	Need for a relational database model to manage structured data effectively.
-	Familiarity with SQL to streamline development tasks and integrate with existing tools and frameworks.
-	Scalability options to accommodate growing data volumes and user loads effectively.
-	Availability of extensive community support to ensure ongoing maintenance and updates.
-	Requirement for a mature and stable database system to mitigate the risk of technical issues.

**Alternative Solutions**

 -  **MongoDB:**
	- Pros: Flexible schema design, horizontal scalability, and native JSON support.
    - Cons: Eventual consistency, may require additional effort for data modeling and migration.

 - **Elasticsearch:**
   - Pros: Full-text search capabilities, real-time indexing, and scalability for text-heavy data.
   - Cons: Primarily designed for search use cases, may not be optimal for transactional data storage.

- **MySQL:**
	- Pros: Widely used and well-supported, mature technology with good performance.
	- Cons: Limited JSON support, less advanced features compared to PostgreSQL.

**Decision:** We have opted to utilize PostgreSQL as the database system for our project.


**Consequences**
- **Development Effort**: Leveraging PostgreSQL may require some initial setup and configuration, as well as potential adjustments to our data model and queries. However, the familiarity of SQL and the availability of resources should streamline development tasks over time.
- **Performance Optimization**: We will need to monitor and optimize the performance of our PostgreSQL database, especially as the volume of data grows. This may involve indexing, query optimization, and other performance tuning techniques to ensure optimal query execution and responsiveness.
- **Data Migration**: If migrating from a different database system, data migration processes and tools will need to be carefully planned and executed to ensure data integrity and minimize downtime.
- **Long-Term Maintenance**: JOngoing maintenance and support of the PostgreSQL database will be necessary, including software updates, security patches, and performance tuning, to ensure continued reliability and efficiency of our database solution. Regular backups and disaster recovery planning should also be implemented to mitigate the risk of data loss.

- **Revisit Date:** This decision should be revisited in one years
